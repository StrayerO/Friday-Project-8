# Friday-Project-8
Repository for FP8 project files.

This project creates a new database file, allows the user to add entries to it, and then check those entries. To do this, the user will click the "Show Feedback" button. In the console, this will prompt the user to enter the password, before printing all information added to the database file, also in the console.

The password is: "BradsPassword" (excluding the quotes).
